    <p>This theme for these books is what would it be like if an immortal, dark ruler had won? An it’s both an excellent idea and a fantastic read, full of very good characters and a plot that gets more complicated as it goes.</p>

<p>Even though it’s not a new book - I think the ten year anniversary editions have been released and gone - the theme of how politics changes people; that it looks at how society is structured and, finally, how people accept their place or not, seems very relevant.</p>

<p>In this case a Lord Ruler, who has been in power for 1,000 years, is toppled by a small band of people. These books tell the story of that group and how they toppled him. It also goes on to what happens next. That’s an interesting point. With books like Brave new world and 1984 it’s always been interesting to me how they got there, as much as what they were like. In this case, going from defeating the Lord Ruler, which might have been a natural point to stop the books, allows the author to explore what the aftermath is like. In this case that’s pretty serious. There is a pretty strict caste system and the 3rd book especially explores the Lord Ruler in a way that suggests while he was the tyrannical dictator that people thought he was, maybe some of that was for a reason.</p>

<p>Initially, I would have said that this was fantasy but as it’s gone on it’s actually more accurate to call it Sci-Fi. They are big books but they don’t feel bloated or in need of editing. I read books 2 and 3 back to back (as did my brother) as they were so good, I also lend the trilogy to a couple I know and they both read them and really enjoyed them. The books feel deep and rich and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an immersive, detailed read.</p>
