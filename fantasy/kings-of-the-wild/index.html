    <p>This was recommended by a friend of mine and was a, fairly unusual, Kindle purchase. It was also the Fantasy Faction 2017 book of the year. So, I had high expectations of it.</p>

<p>The story starts with Clay Cooper (nicknamed Slowhand) working as a guard in a small town, happily living in a modest house with a beautiful wife and daughter. That is until Gabriel, his long time friend and ‘band mate’ turns up looking for help. What follows is a hugely entertaining read. It draws together two things that I really love: Music and Roleplaying. Nick says that the book is based on the idea “What if mercenaries were the rock stars in a fantasy world?” and as someone who roleplayed a lot when I was younger (and has recently returned to Friday night gaming), it felt like how I imagine a D&amp;D session should turn out, without crap dice roles. It’s mainly played for laughs and maybe meandered a bit in the middle but that doesn’t take away from a very enjoyable read. The final battle is one of the most epic scenes I’ve read in a while, and it was as good as the one in Joe Abercrombies Heroes.</p>

<p>It also has a on running gag based on the characters being like the musicians in a band (and the author wrote a bit more about that <a href="https://thequilltolive.com/2017/07/20/kings-of-the-wyld-an-interview-with-nicholas-eames/">in an interview</a>. It could have got old, but it didn’t.</p>

<p>The cross over with music is really strong and I love this comment from the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scenes involving certain characters were often influenced by the instrument they represent. While writing Matrick’s fight against Larkspur’s thralls, I listened to Led Zeppelin’s Moby Dick (essentially a 20+ minute drum solo) on repeat. The same goes for Ganelon. There is a very specific live version of the Stairway to Heaven guitar solo that I’ve probably listened to a thousand times and had in mind whenever Ganelon was destroying people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Re-reading those scenes with the tracks playing is now on the list as is reading Guy Gavriel Kay, who Nick really likes.</p>
