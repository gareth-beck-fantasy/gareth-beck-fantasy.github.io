<p>The thriller genre is hugely successful and one that I’d not been reading until more recently. I think that one of the first ones I read would have been one of the Lee Childs Jack Reacher novels, I can’t remember which one but I do know that I’ve since read all 22 of them (unless that includes the short story anthologies, in which case I’ve read most of them).</p>

<p>There is something very appealing about thrillers and Lee Childs and Harlen Coben both excel in writing character driven stories that use great writing to create real page turners.</p>
